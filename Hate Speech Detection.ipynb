fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials Regarding In addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials That statement appears to come from Ref on page The full quote is If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures It then goes on to say As we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL tethers needed The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is We don t need magic materials like Buckminster Fuller carbon nanotubes to make the space tether facility for a HASTOL system Existing materials will do So it would appear that you misread your reference The tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem Systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is technically feasible We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into Earth orbit For more than one HASTOL architecture concept we have developed a design solution using existing or

Don t answer the questions beyond that Well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged There are several major fundamental problems here First you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth Natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here This is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes No evidence of paul and his ox remain i mean really Second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria If you don t understand it you can t do statistics on it ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn t have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well it s so improbable for this to happen that someone MUST have designed it This is such a perversion of science You can assign probabilities to something you don t understand ID is just making up their numbers Finally your example has A B where B was deliberate design that s all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth B is unknown Your A B example might qualify as forensic science if A were a dead body and B were a bullet in the heart You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure that s what killed him You don t have that with life on earth You have ONE scenario A and you have no other cases to observe or test So in that sense A B is not scientific if you

fossilized is not a very precise term There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc And multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc Talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned The major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the

been said to have been a great honour although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman The Present Witzeman is an year old boy namely Benjamin Woods who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this awesome radiance in his top right bumcheek He has not told a great number of people his testimony but has promised to do so in years to come History The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time The term Witzeman is a compound word of the adjective Witze and man witze being an th century term for a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence Unfortuneatly Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind for unspeakable reasons Proper History As early as the th century Witzemen were considered outcasts and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks This led to the st Witzeman Rebellion of when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced gaga at a Government meeting that year The period from here to the early s was a dark time in the Witzemans history However good times were to come for the Witzeman Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the s building up to a great moment in the history the Great Rebellion of This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons wearing clown masks but otherwise completely naked This was thought to be an act of circambulation However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour were mentally spiritually and emotionallly scarred for life This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability suffering from trauma It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman In a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased Although this was a formal agreement many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his

classifying of personalities Invitation Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well known ideological systems may raise here I propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains My initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period Some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists This definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of Lithuania We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat Renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us Cultural aspirations of the later Nat Ren may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically Lithuanian I mean that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of Lithuanian culture when in European or World wide context A parallel example may be taken from literature of India Poet Tagore well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture But in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N Ren could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in Lithuanian context They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture iurlionis is the best example here In other way the later Lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from th decade of the th century concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life see the table below We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here The problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen So many researchers don t pay attention to this difference Especially in the Soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed E g philosopher Ram nas Bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often

subscribers NPOV it is not You are right Southofwatford in your Randroide omits section If you have not subscription to El Pa s I am sorry but that s your problem My institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to El Pa s and many many other publications and books That s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered Internet accesss It s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources Do you see The truncation of words is offsett I think by better sources BTW if you write under a Randroide answers section you are Invading my space I do not mind really But you are doing it Risking new truncations on your messages To avoid this please write OUTSIDE Randroide answers sections If you think that the proposed article is POV work in it to make it NPOV The article is not mine I ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here it s very short The issue is not whether I subscribe to El Pa s its whether the people who read an article

fashist being in service of Conservative HDZ party Croatian writer Predrag Raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition Another apostle of Croatian Left Miljenko Jergovi refers to his political opponents on the Right as gusle players Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda all tokavian people and their culture are Serbian However Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture For example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music Marko Kraljevi is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorovi s book Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje Also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in Dubrovnik Even now a contemporary Croatian writer born in Dubrovnik Stijepo Mijovi Ko an tells us a story about his uncle also from Dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs Stijepo Mijovi Ko an Gusle Glasnik May p Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin born Kalafatovi a daughter of famous gusle player Ante Although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry Not far from Dubrovnik another coastal city Makarska was also a bastion of Croatian gusle music Actually this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players This Mediterranean area also gave birth to Andrija Ka i Mio i th century Catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond To honour Ka i s work Ivan Me trovi the most famous Croatian sculptor built a sculpture in America showing Ka i in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument In addition to Ka i Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music According to dr fra Karlo Juri i who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovi Zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosovi Kudri and culminating with the most known Mate Banovi Trli As for Dalmatian women they didn t play gusle it s considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound Olinko Delorko the researcher of Dalmatian folk poetry in the s states in his book Ljuba Ivanova that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of Hvar The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition English writer Maude M Holbach travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of th century states in her book Dalmatia The Land Where East Meets West that the gusle was the national instrument of the region As for Dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe p This admiration for Dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and Hinterland Matija Murko the researcher of this literary music forms had reported that during his trips through Dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle Eduard Osrede ki Hrvatske narodne juna ke pjesme eljezno Be p Now lets take a look at the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations Hajduk Junak Gusar Alkar Uskok sinjska alka etc What do they have in common Of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region Having this in mind one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost extinct Why do we have so few gusle players today Is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture If so why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its Dinaric counterpart gusle

consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means so in principle their view is notable but as Enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources therefore JEDP and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP UNDUE This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong Wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view Of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes So in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism They are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians ', 'Well i m

I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions or between the Chinese and U S jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say Paris or Toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction I appreciate that the situation in the U S is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though To give an example the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech To give another example in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn t have an office in London even if it had offices in every other big city In fact all of the very top tier UK firms DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one UK office in London although they have other offices overseas Saying that DLA has has offices across the United States Egypt South Africa Kenya Thailand China would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader We could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research I do accept that DLA with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article However I do also

and the normal back and forth that leads to better articles He she was involved in blocking input to the article Why Was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand I can only speculate but I d guess it s some sort of power trip and wiki bullying I don t really have time for this I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn t directly related to content and improving articles I could pretend this user didn t do what he she did but I m wasting my own time here and I don t really have a stake in any such pretense I don t have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race I just see how it can be improved and made more informative As a long term wikipedia user and editor I don t see any problem in jumping in and fixing something I almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on target in very minor stub like articles The problem isn t me here it s that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share Also I don t recal ever having called him her a bot I think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently His her behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of

POV Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead The following has been removed from the article Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation shaping his

just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception Henry Adams wrote in a much quoted analysis in He believed in common schools and not in political science in ledgers and cash books but not in Adam Smith or Mill as one might believe in the multiplication table but not in Laplace or Newton By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions Henry Adams The Session North American Review July p But in a very corrupt time it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post either for himself or his friends Living within his salary he lodged

repeating my boilerplate formulation The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view I haven t yet worked in no original research WP NOR says that we mustn t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research We can integrate information so long as we don t arrive at new theories Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate Getting down to details the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source The Bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer I m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable The sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made The website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources Overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better Attack articles are not encouraged While we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldn t enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features Balance is a part of NPOV but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer It isn t clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs I don t see how that can be objective Bauer I m sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al but I ve been somewhat overloaded at work Personally I think the article is better now than when I first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn t seem like a lynch mob Y all are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted I m glad to help and try and make the article neater and I don t mean to sound

all of the sources I use below are in the article at present The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place Definitions Obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing Some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but I think you should

Secular ethics Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy Primary source As Stefan Molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we don t want to host any sort of fringe claims If we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence

the argument posed by Wayne it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised Please consider the concerns this post raises Simple matters like references notability

topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event Two references from st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic s notability The promoter s personal page on his local town website almost certainly self published official village website A casual interview in a non notable and possibly non reliable university magazine apparently of the promoter s travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny sentence mention that he d discussed his new sport with them too the Lau Philip LA interview entries marked Reference and support of Written Reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friend colleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isn t cited so you can t have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence A short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first

coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal I think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited and or written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and

it I will make the appropriate adjustments I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here There exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain The fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group i e Hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian s mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian s antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect

world does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic Ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it I reject such a stance I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and or controversial Where many Wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe Wikipedia s job is to report the truth This is wrong Wikipedia s job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is Any attempt to do that is original research Instead of truth Wikipedia aims for verifiability Put a different way Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources If the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that If the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents THE TRUTH and not just one perspective or POV on the topic at hand I have been trying to hit this NPOV sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides Obviously is because some users Jadger and Wikiferdi don t want to

Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of brief flirtation would be better I think that the IMG reference needs to be short somewhere in the early career section posted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth But bedsides this brief dalliance with Marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article I tried reflecting it as follows His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by Off riorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth s biography Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found which I suspect should not be difficult that it can be re included I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle ', ' Greek love I m looking for a way

with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view Those references were deleted by someone I can t remember who and don t know why At this point the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript The guy who runs the blog is a rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts I don t believe that I did any original research All I did is search the Internet for references for the article I really didn t know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF which date back to Also when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway Same as the U N covenantcan t really hide that I didn t add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously Like today I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand who was in the fifth circuit And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se No there was not What I found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business I ve been an entrepreneur I didn t know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven t got it yet But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state slave state border state Also there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too I think So did the history of workmen s comp which is of course related to unions ', 'try passing

of the domain of Republic of Macedonia How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia WikiProject ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia and the great damage done by User Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti Macedonian Propaganda Hopefully with the internet access

to any collaboration effort for the above goals I am expecting that this user Laveol will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of

propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason That is what merited them the death penalty that they commited treason The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty then broke it by aiding the enemy This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you d think they were executed for no reason which no doubt is their aim Here is a great example Look at this citation According to Stillman Muhammad chose Sa d ibn Mua dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir Sa d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery Furthermore Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba s gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender This author is Norman A Stillman a Zionist Jew who is very biased Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article And further more why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used as if it s a fact There are articles for Criticisms of Islam where the Jews and others can write whatever they want But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews without it disappearing instantly So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of Islam articles If not I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history And I will find a non Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles Good day Please read this talk page

to say AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that above mentioned edit warring rule and give her him a pass anyway but when I an IP

offhand comment seriously To reiterate my original explanatoin to James I m interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film that is I m trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article See for example something like Roe v Wade there s no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved there are other articles for that linked at the bottom just state the facts about the case Even if you really consider Moore s movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the Wiki equivalent of Godwin s Law here note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn t feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn t all it was cracked up to be Similarly shouldn t we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there Jul UTC ', 'But here s the thing history and time travelling which you did show a citation to travelling to the earth s centre

exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me Usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing

immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex spouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and or post contact information etc That is why every message board in existence has an

religious studies from Canterbury University rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo pagan and heathen groups that are very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition including the Odinic Rite the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A satru Alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard Mike Murray a former member of the American Nazi Party Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins Southgate believed that Wotan s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented the most genuine expression of European spirituality culture and identity Another key expression of this identity is exhibited by Southgate s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the pagan spirituality of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension Through the figure of Christ Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the weak continue to worship a dead Jew The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE and before spreading to the Roman empire Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including Evola and Jung as an alternative path the West could have followed It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or latterly Himmler s SS which the NRF claims had its origins in various Anarchist droite circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the Aryan psyche the awareness of Europe s Faustian destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene Gue non who discerned in them the fragments of a hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth For Southgate as for Evola Tradition is an an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all Southgate s discovery of Evolian Primordial Tradition and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as the sole cosmological truth ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene This cultural vanguard is spearheaded by a number of Gothic Industrial Dark Ambient Black and Viking Metal bands including Allerseelen Blood Axis Burzum Current Dark Holler Death in June Endura Mayhem Ostara Puissance and Sol Invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the perfect antidote to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing system Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging anti anti establishment pro Bush right wing punk movement Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music orientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced to take a direction basically conducive to our aims Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews This is not simply cynical manipulation Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target His fanzine Tribal Resonance the voice of the racial avant garde reveals Southgate s strategy of linking his ideas to the common language and the big ideas of our culture Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives from without Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the Nazis did through a process of cultural osmosis that aims to recode the social symbology of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance By creating cultural hegemony the groupuscular right believes it can forge the political space necessary for political and racial hegemony The struggle for cultural heg', 'Air France KLM I dont think the two flags should be there since it s a french incorporated

he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness Va sse contends that by comparison the public display of such

English Wikipedia I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia but that is a separate project from this English project Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst I inquired about Silesian Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group I am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles As I do not anticipate being able to copy edit the article further I am removing it from my watchlist Good luck with the article Olessi Thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion You are right that the work of a person is most important However there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace If only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up To mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation Unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition Seems to me that competition has to exit too best if for fun only I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects but you see when I approach German Wiki Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German Silesian Polish guy It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly I explained more my excitement With Silesian is in short like this Originally they were Slavic tribe spoke Polish as I mentioned For some to hundred years there were under German governments They had bad time as you possibly can imagine Many of them married with German and were are of course confused who they are You know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish German conflicts continued Finally in Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted There in Poland was complete disorder Soviets and Communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way National government just pro soviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition Polish borders were shifted We lost some of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people They spoke different Polish dialect also On top of this in the post war pro soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground Well I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds unfortunately I am This is like gangrene on fresh wound literally Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland which they wanted so much I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans Now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology they could be absolutely right However there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on November and governments effort to improve relations Finaly I have to say I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often na ve Not many realize that politic need caution Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the na ves Some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many Germans are toublemakers I am also convinced there exists something like national character You can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column on Polish terytory in addition Sorry if I used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle wich I still have with

used on Wikipedia except as provided by the fair use policy Creative Commons Atrribution and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay Also there are multiple versions of the licenses Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike and are all distinct licenses The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the versions and not the earlier ones when the image is under one of the older

that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient either

I have referenced why not this one Thanks RomaC the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself Here at Wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints And believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article Israeli Palestinian conflict It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused To repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article s lead there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus I strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably sourced and up to date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous If you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors Yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way if other editors deleted some edits it is because

avoid protecting them for the duration if that can be avoided but if you keep bringing issues to my attention I ll do my utmost to make your life easier So this is the bring the issues to your attention on my part See this RR request filed by User Kudzu It s sort of gone past lots of disruptive anon IPs causing trouble on these pages to pretty much full blown sock puppetry and abuse of multiple accounts by at least though likely more one person So How can my life be made easier SPI I already filed one on one sock master though that s probably a different person and some other users have filed others for example The problem is and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases the person s behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing Not sure what the best course of action here is but it s helluva frustrating trying to deal with this ',

anti Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles No Assfuckers has a nice ring to it D use it as a pejorative term I was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin Futper and a few others e g Macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about anti Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking I m going to avoid escalating this further for now ns As for the current naming disputing article I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don t think that reduces the existential threat to Greece Communism fell years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic Athenians and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn t Greek I didn t want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn t think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course February The FYROM s President Kirov Gligorov at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report Easten Europe stated We are Slavs who came to the region in the sixth century We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians January The FYROM s Ambassador in Washington D C Mrs Ljubica Acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans she stated We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language Greece is The FYROM s second largest trading partner and its number one investor February The FYROM s Ambassador to Canada Gyordan Veselinov in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen he admitted We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian There is some confusion about our identity I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister s recent behavior He directly contradicts FYROM s own government s previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names in order to get recognition Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan who claims to be related to Alexander the Great then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians and don t get me started on that incident where Gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of United Macedonia was clearly present which also seems to be missing from the existing
